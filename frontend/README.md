# Project Outline

This document outlines the key components and phases for developing a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) using React.js. The goal is to create a robust, scalable, and user-friendly platform for managing educational content and tracking student progress.

## 1. Project Overview

The LMS will be a web-based application with two primary user roles:

- **Students:** Can enroll in courses, view course materials, complete assignments, and track their progress.
- **Instructors:** Can create, edit, and publish courses; upload educational content (videos, PDFs, quizzes); and monitor student performance.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1. User Management

- **Authentication:**
    - Sign-up/Login for both students and instructors.
    - Password reset functionality.
    - Role-based access control (Students vs. Instructors).
- **User Profiles:**
    - View and edit personal information.
    - Display profile picture, name, and bio.

### 2.2. Course Management

- **Course Creation (Instructor):**
    - Create new courses with a title, description, and thumbnail.
    - Organize courses into categories.
- **Course Enrollment (Student):**
    - Browse and search for courses.
    - Enroll in a course.
- **Course Content:**
    - Structure courses into modules and lessons.
    - Support various content types: text, video embeds, images, downloadable files (PDFs, documents).
    - Quizzes and assignments.

### 2.3. Content Delivery & Progress Tracking

- **Learning Page:**
    - A dedicated page for each lesson.
    - Video player for video content.
    - Interactive elements for quizzes and assignments.
- **Progress Tracking:**
    - Mark lessons as complete.
    - Display a progress bar for each course.
    - Generate a certificate of completion upon finishing a course.

### 2.4. Communication & Notifications

- **Announcements:**
    - Instructors can post announcements for their courses.
- **Notifications:**
    - Receive notifications for new announcements, assignments, or course updates.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Frontend (React.js):**
    - **Core Framework:** React.js
    - **State Management:** React Context API or a library like Zustand/Redux for more complex state.
    - **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach and responsive design.
    - **Component Library:** shadcn/ui for pre-built, accessible UI components (optional, but highly recommended).
    - **Icons:** Lucide React or Font Awesome.
- **Backend (API):**
    - Node.js with Express.js or a similar framework.
    - RESTful API to handle data requests from the frontend.
    - Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user sessions.
- **Database:**
    - **Relational:** PostgreSQL or MySQL.
    - **NoSQL:** MongoDB or Firestore (if using a Firebase backend).
- **Deployment:**
    - Frontend: Vercel or Netlify.
    - Backend: Heroku or a cloud provider like Google Cloud/AWS.

## 4. UI/UX Design

- **Responsive Design:** The application must be fully responsive and work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Dashboard:** A user-specific dashboard that shows enrolled courses, progress, and recent activity.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** A clear and simple navigation bar and a logical flow for students and instructors.
- **Instructor Interface:** A separate, clean interface for instructors to manage their courses, view student analytics, and upload content easily.
